    <h1> INGREDIANTS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>600 gm boiled potato </li>
        <li> salt</li>
        <li> turmeric powder</li>
        <li> green chilli </li>
        <li> 1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li> cumin seeds</li>
        <li> warm water</li>
        <li> spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> PROCESS TO MAKE ALOO SAMOSA</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Start by adding all the dough ingredients (except water) into a bowl and mix them well.  Gradually add water to the mixture and knead it until you achieve a smooth, non-sticky dough. The dough should be a little firm.</li>
        <img src="./ap1.jpg" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>Cover the dough and allow it to rest for about twenty to thirty minutes. </li>
        <img src="./ap2.jpg" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>In a large pan, add oil. When hot, add the spices, salt, green chili, and coriander. Fry these for a few seconds </li>
        <img src="./ap3.jpg" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>Mash the potato leaving a few small chunks and add them to the previously fried spices. Cook this mixture for about two minutes on medium heat. Then turn off the heat and allow the filling to come to room temperature. </li>
        <img src="./ap4.jpg" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>Divide the dough into four equal balls. Take one ball and roll it into a medium-thickness circle of about six inches using a rolling pin. You won’t need flour to roll this dough.</li>
        <img src="./ap5.jpg" width="250px" height="200">
        <li> Use a knife to cut the circle in half. Take one-half and fold it into a cone. Make sure to seal along the fold.</li>
        <img src="./ap6.webp" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>Hold the cone between your thumb and index finger. Fill the cone with the filling, which might take two tablespoons or a little less. </li>
        <img src="./ap8.webp" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>Wet the edges of the dough with water and pinch to seal. You should now have a triangle-shaped samosa. Repeat this step with the rest of the dough and filling. </li>
        <img src="./ap7.jpg" width="250px" height="200">
        <li> Cover the samosas with a cloth and keep them aside for twenty minutes in a cool place. This step helps the samosas to have fewer bubbles on the pastry when frying.</li>
        <img src="./ap9.webp" width="250px" height="200">
        <li>In a medium pan, heat the frying oil. Add the samosas but do not crowd the pan. Fry them on medium heat until they turn golden brown. The frying time may take between seven to eight minutes, depending on the size of the samosa.        </li>

        <h1> PRECAUTIONS</h1>
        <ul> 
            <li> Don’t overheat the oil; the samosa might turn black. 175°C to 190°C is the ideal temperature to fry the samosa. </li>
            <li> Make sure to keep flipping the samosa to make them more golden.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants crispy and crunchy samosas, so you need thin patti to get the extra crisp and crackle sound.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
